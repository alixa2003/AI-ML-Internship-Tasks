## Dataset Used

Kaggle data.csv house price dataset

## Models Applied

* Linear Regression

* Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Key Results

* Linear Regression

MAE: 123,456.30

RMSE: 216,669.22

R²: 0.56

* Gradient Boosting

MAE: 121,168.53

RMSE: 217,668.81

R²: 0.56

Best Model: Linear Regression

R² Score: 0.5646

Performs similarly to Gradient Boosting

The data show mostly linear patterns, so a simple model works fine.
